# VSCode Online via Docker

VSCode Online via Docker allows you to run a full-featured Visual Studio Code environment accessible through your web browser. This setup is perfect for developers looking for an easily accessible and consistent coding environment.

## Installation

Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system. Then, create a `docker-compose.yml` file based on the provided example configuration. Place this file in your project directory.

To start the VSCode server, navigate to your project directory and run:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Or
```
sudo docker-compose up -d
```


## Usage

Access your VSCode environment by navigating to `http://<ip-or-localhost>:8443` in a web browser. Replace `<ip-or-localhost>` with the actual IP address or `localhost` if running on your local machine. Enter the password defined in the `PASSWORD` environment variable when prompted.
